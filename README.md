# React CRUD Application

This project is a React CRUD application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing events, categories, locations, and organizers. It works in conjunction with the Express, Node.js, and MySQL backend.

## Getting Started

To get started with the React app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/keven-bardales/events_App_REACT.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. You need to check the repo [ eventsApp_Node_Express](https://github.com/keven-bardales/eventsApp_Node_Express) to set up the backend generated with Express.
4. Run the application: `npm run dev`

## Backend

The React CRUD application requires the backend API provided by the Express, Node.js, and MySQL project. Make sure to set up the backend server and have it running before using the React app.

For detailed instructions on setting up the backend, refer to the [Express, Node.js, and MySQL Project](https://github.com/keven-bardales/eventsApp_Node_Express).
